# Project summary
We are building a modern SaaS application that will enable businesses to automate the request, collection and verification of information from their customers. There are two components to this SaaS, one an admin dashboard for businesses to use to create, manage and verify information from customers and a separate component which is an embeddable widget that businesses can place on their site to render requirements for customers to return to the business. 

We are only focusing on the business admin dashboard for now. The dashboard should have the following menu options:
Overview
Clients
Verification
Activity
Settings
Requirement templates
Brand configuration
Email configuration
Payment gateway
API configuration
Installation
Support
Account


## Framework
We are using React with typescript, tailwind ui, and tailwind css. I am building the backend separately using Xano which is a no-code backend tool. Xano has an sdk enabling easy connection with the service. 

Iâ€™ve bought the tailwind ui components so every single component is available for use. I can provide the code for some of these components when required. 

## Styles and colours
The SaaS will use Inter as its main font. The SaaS should be light but have darker accents. Light will just be white, darker accents should be #1C2A3A.
